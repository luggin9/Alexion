                                <p><span>Life-threatening meningococcal infections/sepsis have occurred</span> in patients treated with ULTOMIRIS. Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Comply with the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for meningococcal vaccination in patients with complement deficiencies.</li>
                                    <li>Immunize patients with meningococcal vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of ULTOMIRIS, unless the risks of delaying ULTOMIRIS therapy outweigh the risk of developing a meningococcal infection. See <em>Warnings and Precautions</em> for additional guidance on the management of the risk of meningococcal infection.</li>
                                    <li>Vaccination reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of meningococcal infections. Monitor patients for early signs of meningococcal infections and evaluate immediately if infection is suspected.</li>

                            <p class="m-0"><u>Risk and Prevention</u></p>
                            <p>Life-threatening meningococcal infections have occurred in patients treated with ULTOMIRIS.  The use of ULTOMIRIS increases a patient’s susceptibility to serious meningococcal infections (septicemia and/or meningitis). Meningococcal disease due to any serogroup may occur.</p>
                            <p>
                                Vaccinate or revaccinate for meningococcal disease according to the most current ACIP recommendations for patients with complement deficiencies. Immunize patients without history of meningococcal vaccination at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of ULTOMIRIS. If ULTOMIRIS must be initiated immediately in an unvaccinated patient, administer meningococcal vaccine(s) as soon as possible and provide 2 weeks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis. In clinical studies, 59 adult patients with PNH were treated with ULTOMIRIS less than 2 weeks after meningococcal vaccination. All of these patients received antibiotics for prophylaxis of meningococcal infection until at least 2 weeks after meningococcal vaccination. The benefits and risks of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of meningococcal infections in patients receiving ULTOMIRIS have not been established. In PNH clinical studies in adult patients, 3 out of 261 PNH patients developed serious meningococcal infections/sepsis while receiving treatment with ULTOMIRIS; all 3 had been vaccinated. These 3 patients recovered while continuing treatment with ULTOMIRIS. Consider discontinuation of ULTOMIRIS in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious meningococcal infection.
                            </p>
                            <p><u>REMS</u><br />
                                Under the ULTOMIRIS REMS, prescribers must enroll in the program due to the risk of meningococcal infections. Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of meningococcal infection/sepsis, provide the patients with the REMS educational materials, and ensure patients are vaccinated with meningococcal vaccines.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Other Infections</strong><br />
                                Patients may have increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria infections, especially infections caused by <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> but also <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and to a lesser extent, <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>. Children treated with ULTOMIRIS may be at increased risk of developing serious infections due to <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b (Hib). Administer vaccinations for the prevention of <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b (Hib) infections according to ACIP guidelines. If ULTOMIRIS is administered to patients with active systemic infections, monitor closely for worsening infection.
                            </p>

                                <strong>Monitoring Disease Manifestations after ULTOMIRIS Discontinuation</strong><br />
                                <u>Treatment Discontinuation for PNH</u><br />
                                After discontinuing treatment with ULTOMIRIS, closely  monitor for signs and symptoms of hemolysis, identified by elevated LDH along with  sudden decrease in PNH clone size or hemoglobin, or re-appearance of symptoms such as  fatigue, hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath (dyspnea), major adverse  vascular event (including thrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction. Monitor any patient who discontinues ULTOMIRIS for at least 16 weeks to detect hemolysis and other reactions. If signs and symptoms of hemolysis occur after discontinuation, including elevated LDH, consider restarting treatment with ULTOMIRIS.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <u>Treatment Discontinuation for aHUS</u><br />
                                ULTOMIRIS treatment of aHUS should be a minimum duration of 6 months. Due to heterogeneous nature of aHUS events and patient-specific risk factors, treatment duration beyond the initial 6 months should be individualized. There are no specific data on ULTOMIRIS discontinuation. After discontinuing treatment with ULTOMIRIS, patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms and laboratory signs of TMA complications for at least 12 months.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                TMA complications post-discontinuation can be identified if any of the following is observed: Clinical symptoms of TMA include changes in mental status, seizures, angina, dyspnea, thrombosis or increasing blood pressure. In addition, at least two of the following laboratory signs observed concurrently and results should be confirmed by a second measurement 28 days apart with no interruption: a decrease in platelet count of 25% or more as compared to either baseline or to peak platelet count during ULTOMIRIS treatment; an increase in serum creatinine of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during ULTOMIRIS treatment; or, an increase in serum LDH of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during ULTOMIRIS treatment. If TMA complications occur after discontinuation, consider reinitiation of ULTOMIRIS treatment or appropriate organ-specific supportive measures.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Thromboembolic Event Management</strong><br />
                                The effect of withdrawal of anticoagulant therapy during treatment with ULTOMIRIS has not been established. Treatment should not alter anticoagulant management.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Infusion-Related Reactions</strong><br />
                                Administration of ULTOMIRIS may result in infusion-related reactions including anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions. In clinical trials, 4 out of 309 patients treated with ULTOMIRIS experienced infusion-related reactions (lower back pain, drop in blood pressure, elevation in blood pressure and limb discomfort) during ULTOMIRIS administration which did not require discontinuation. Interrupt infusion and institute supportive measures if signs of cardiovascular instability or respiratory compromise occur.

                                <u>Adverse Reactions for aHUS</u><br />
                                Most common adverse reactions in patients with aHUS (incidence ≥20%) were upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, hypertension and pyrexia. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 42 (57%) patients with aHUS receiving ULTOMIRIS. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in more than 2 patients (2.7%) treated with ULTOMIRIS were hypertension, pneumonia and abdominal pain. In clinical studies, clinically relevant adverse reactions in &lt;10% of patients include viral tonsillitis in adults and viral infection in pediatric patients and in 3% of adult patients include infusion-related reactions.
